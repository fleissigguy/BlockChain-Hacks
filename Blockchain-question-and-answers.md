## Blockchain questions and answers 

What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores transaction records.

What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is powered by the Bitcoin blockchain.

What makes blockchain efficient?
Blockchain is efficient because of its transparency.

Who owns a blockchain?
A blockchain is not owned by a single entity, but it is owned by everyone participating in validating the transactions.

What does a single point of failure mean?
A single point of failure means that there is a point of origin for a system, and if it fails, the entire system fails.

Can a blockchain be hacked?
It is almost impossible to hack a blockchain because there is no point of origin for the blockchain.

What is the hardware layer in blockchain?
The hardware layer in blockchain is the network of computers that contribute to the computing power of the blockchain.

What is a node in blockchain?
A node is a computer or a network of computers which decrypt transactions.

What is the data layer in blockchain?
The data layer in blockchain is where details of transactions are stored.

What is a block in blockchain?
A block is the fundamental unit of a blockchain.

What information is stored on a block in blockchain?
A block in blockchain stores details of the crypto sent, the public key of the receiver, and the private key of the sender.

How are blocks connected in a blockchain?
Each block which has data is connected to the previous block and the next block which is generated. Only the genesis block, the first block of the network, is connected forwards and not backward.

What is the network layer in blockchain?
The network layer in blockchain deals with the communication between nodes on a blockchain.

Why is communication necessary in blockchain?
Communication is necessary in blockchain because each node has to know about the transactions which other nodes are validating.

What is the consensus layer in blockchain?
The consensus layer in blockchain is responsible for the validation of a block.

What is Proof of Work in blockchain?
Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism in blockchain where validators compete and solve a cryptic mathematic puzzle, and the one who solves first will be the one to add the block to the blockchain.

What is Proof of Stake in blockchain?
Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism in blockchain where the validator is randomly picked by the system.

What is the Application layer in blockchain?
The Application layer in blockchain is the one on which apps are built.

What kind of apps can be built on the Application layer in blockchain?
Applications like wallets, social media apps, browsers, Defi apps, and NFT platforms can be built on the Application layer in blockchain.

What is the difference between normal applications and blockchain applications?
The difference is the decentralized nature of data storage at the backend of blockchain applications.

What are the five layers of blockchain?
The five layers of blockchain are the hardware infrastructure layer, data layer, network layer, consensus layer, and application layer.

What is the purpose of the hardware infrastructure layer in blockchain?
The purpose of the hardware infrastructure layer in blockchain is to form the network of computers that contribute to the computing power of the blockchain.

What is the purpose of the data layer in blockchain?
The purpose of the data layer in blockchain is to store details of transactions.

What is the purpose of the network layer in blockchain?
The purpose of the network layer in blockchain is to enable communication between nodes on a blockchain.

What is the purpose of the consensus layer in blockchain?
The purpose of the consensus layer in blockchain is to validate a block.
