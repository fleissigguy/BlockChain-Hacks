## Various blockchain layers with exmaples 

## Layer 0:

### Bitcoin: 
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that relies on a distributed network of computers to process transactions. It is built on the layer 0 infrastructure and utilizes the internet, hardware, and connections to make blockchain a reality.

### Ethereum: 
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of it. It is built on layer 0 infrastructure and provides a secure and reliable foundation for developers to build on.

### Solana: 
Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that is built on layer 0 infrastructure. It is designed to handle a large number of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications that require high throughput.

## Layer 1:

### Cardano: 
Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that is built on layer 1. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which makes it more energy-efficient than other blockchains.

### Polkadot: 
Polkadot is a sharded blockchain platform that is built on layer 1. It provides interoperability between different blockchain networks and allows developers to build decentralized applications on top of it.

### Stellar: 
Stellar is a blockchain platform that is built on layer 1. It is designed to facilitate cross-border payments and allows users to send and receive different currencies quickly and cheaply.

## Layer 2:

### Lightning Network: 
The Lightning Network is a layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that enables fast and cheap transactions by creating a network of payment channels between users.

### Loopring: 
Loopring is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without having to deposit funds on an exchange.

### Raiden Network: 
The Raiden Network is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum that enables fast and cheap transactions by creating a network of payment channels between users.

## Layer 3:

### Augur: 
Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform that is built on layer 3. It allows users to bet on the outcome of events and earn rewards for accurate predictions.

### Uniswap: 
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is built on layer 3. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a central exchange.

### Chainlink: 
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is built on layer 3. It provides real-world data to blockchain applications, making them more useful in real-world scenarios.
