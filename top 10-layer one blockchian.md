## Top 10 layer one block chain 

Bitcoin (BTC) - The first and largest cryptocurrency, designed as a decentralized digital currency for peer-to-peer transactions.

Ethereum (ETH) - A decentralized blockchain platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to be built on top of it.

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - A blockchain platform that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and enables developers to build dApps using Solidity.

Cardano (ADA) - A blockchain platform that uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and is designed for the development of complex dApps.

Solana (SOL) - A high-performance blockchain platform that is designed to support high-speed transactions and complex dApps.

Polkadot (DOT) - A multi-chain platform that enables interoperability between different blockchains, making it possible for dApps to communicate with each other.

Avalanche (AVAX) - A highly scalable and interoperable blockchain platform that enables the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Terra (LUNA) - A blockchain platform that enables the creation of stablecoins and decentralized finance applications.

Algorand (ALGO) - A blockchain platform that uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus algorithm and is designed to support high-speed transactions and the development of scalable dApps.

Chainlink (LINK) - A decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely access off-chain data and interact with external systems.
