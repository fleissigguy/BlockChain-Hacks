## Blockchain layers with tech stack 

## Layer 0:

Networking protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and HTTPS
Operating systems such as Linux and Windows
Hardware components such as CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs
Examples of Layer 0 blockchain technology stack:

Bitcoin: Uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, which requires specialized hardware (ASICs) to mine new blocks on the blockchain.
Ethereum: Uses the Ethash PoW consensus algorithm, which is memory-intensive and requires a GPU to mine new blocks.
Chia: Uses the Proof of Space and Time (PoST) consensus algorithm, which requires hard disk space to mine new blocks on the blockchain.


## Layer 1:

Blockchain protocol implementation such as Bitcoin Core, Geth, and Parity
Smart contract languages such as Solidity and Vyper
Virtual machines such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM)
Examples of Layer 1 blockchain technology stack:

Bitcoin: Uses the Bitcoin Core software implementation and supports scripting using Bitcoin Script.
Ethereum: Uses the Geth or Parity software implementation and supports smart contract development using Solidity or Vyper.
EOS: Uses the EOSIO software implementation and supports smart contract development using C++.

## Layer 2:

Payment channel technologies such as Lightning Network and Raiden Network
Sidechain technologies such as Liquid and Plasma
State channels and sidechain technologies such as Connext and Counterfactual
Examples of Layer 2 blockchain technology stack:

Lightning Network: Uses payment channels to allow for fast and cheap transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Plasma: Uses sidechains to provide scalability for Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.
xDai: Uses a combination of sidechains and payment channels to provide fast and cheap transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Layer 3:

Decentralized application (dApp) development frameworks such as Truffle and Embark
Middleware technologies such as IPFS and Swarm
Oracle networks such as Chainlink and Band Protocol
Examples of Layer 3 blockchain technology stack:

Augur: Uses a custom dApp development framework to build a decentralized prediction market platform.
Arweave: Uses IPFS and other middleware technologies to provide a decentralized storage network.
Chainlink: Uses an oracle network to provide real-world data to blockchain applications.
